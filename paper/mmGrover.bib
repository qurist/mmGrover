abstract = {Inspired by a class of algorithms proposed by Farhi et al. (arXiv:1411.4028), namely the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we present a circuit-based quantum algorithm to search for a needle in a haystack, obtaining the same quadratic speedup achieved by Grover's original algorithm. In our algorithm, the problem Hamiltonian (oracle) and a transverse field are applied alternately to the system in a periodic manner. We introduce a technique, based on spin-coherent states, to analyze the composite unitary in a single period. This composite unitary drives a closed transition between two states that have high degrees of overlap with the initial state and the target state, respectively. The transition rate in our algorithm is of order {\$}\backslashTheta(1/\backslashsqrt N){\$}, and the overlaps are of order {\$}\backslashTheta(1){\$}, yielding a nearly optimal query complexity of {\$}T\backslashsimeq \backslashsqrt N (\backslashpi/2\backslashsqrt 2\backslash,){\$}. Our algorithm is a QAOA circuit that demonstrates a quantum advantage with a large number of iterations that is not derived from Trotterization of an adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) algorithm. It also suggests that the analysis required to understand QAOA circuits involves a very different process from estimating the energy gap of a Hamiltonian in AQO.},

@article{Uhrig2009,
abstract = {Two recent developments in quantum control, concatenation and optimization of pulse intervals, are combined to yield a strategy to suppress unwanted couplings in quantum systems to high order. Longitudinal relaxation and transverse dephasing can be suppressed so that systems with a small splitting between their energy levels can be kept isolated from their environment. The required number of pulses grows exponentially with the desired order but is only the square root of the number needed if only concatenation is used. An approximate scheme even brings the number down to polynomial growth. The approach is expected to be useful for quantum information and for high-precision nuclear magnetic resonance. PACS numbers: 82.56.Jn, 76.60.Lz, 03.67.Pp, 03.65.Yz If one wants to measure small shifts in local energy levels high-precision nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful means of investigation. In order to reduce the line widths which limit the achievable resolution it is important to isolate the system under study as much as possible from its environment. It is common in NMR to do this by intricate sequences of pulses, see e.g. Ref. 1. Similarly, one of the big hurdles in the realization of quantum information (QI) is to keep information stored without loss due to decoherence. Besides quantum error correction, see e.g. [2, 3], dynamic decoupling (DD) is one important tool to reduce decoherence [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Here, as for NMR, a sequence of pulses is used to achieve an effective Hamiltonian where the quantum bit (qubit) is as much isolated from its environment as possible. So in both these fascinating areas of physics the design of appropriate pulse sequences is of great relevance. The fundamental idea is to compensate the effect of a Hamiltonian (or a part of it) by inverting its sign by a $\pi$ pulse. This is known since long as spin-echo technique [10] which works very nicely for static magnetic fields. Its sequence reads p SE = f $\tau$ $\pi$ f $\tau$ . Further improvement is obtained by passing to the combination of two pules in p CPMG = f $\tau$ $\pi$ f 2$\tau$ $\pi$ f $\tau$ [11, 12] which is commonly called CPMG after the first letters of its inventors. The total duration of the cycle is t = 4$\tau$ . Here $\pi$ stands for an ideal, instantaneous $\pi$ pulse which takes a part of the Hamiltonian to its negative while f $\tau$ stand for the time evolution due to the unchanged Hamiltonian over the in-terval $\tau$ . Both basic cylces are commonly iterated: the iteration of the spin echo leads to p PDD = f $\tau$ ($\pi$ f $\tau$) n with t = (n + 1)$\tau$ which is often called periodic dynamic de-coupling (PDD). The iteration of the CPMG leads to p iCPMG = (f $\tau$ $\pi$ f $\tau$) 2n with t = 2n$\tau$ which is success-ful in many circumstances, see for instance Refs. 13, 14.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian oracles are the continuum limit of the standard unitary quantum oracles. In this limit, the problem of finding the optimal query algorithm can be mapped into the problem of finding shortest paths on a manifold. The study of these shortest paths leads to lower bounds of the original unitary oracle problem. A number of example Hamiltonian oracles are studied in this paper, including oracle interrogation and the problem of computing the xor of the hidden bits. Both of these problems are related to the study of geodesics on spheres with non-round metrics. For the case of two hidden bits a complete description of the geodesics is given. For n hidden bits a simple lower bound is proven that shows the problems require a query time proportional to n, even in the continuum limit. Finally, the problem of continuous Grover search is reexamined leading to a modest improvement to the protocol of Farhi and Gutmann.},

In this method, first the original optimal control problem is transformed into a nonlinear two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) via the Pontryagin's maximum principle. Then, the nonlinear TPBVP is transformed into a sequence of linear time-invariant TPBVPs using the homotopy perturbation method (HPM) and introducing a convex homotopy in topologic space. Solving the latter problems through an iterative process yields the optimal control law and optimal trajectory in the form of infinite series. Finally, sufficient condition for convergence of these series is proved by a theorem. Simplicity and efficiency of the proposed method is shown through an illustrative example.},

Stephen Moye of the American Math Society helped me a lot with AMSTeX versus LaTeX issues. My thanks also to Atilla Yilmaz for spotting lots of typos and errors, which I have corrected. I have radically modified much of the notation (to be consistent with my other writings), updated the references, added several new examples, and provided a proof of the PontryaginMaximumPrinciple. As this is a course for undergraduates, I have dispensed in certain proofs with various measurability and continuity issues, and as compensation have added various critiques as to the lack of total rigor. This current version of the notes is not yet complete, but meets I think the usual high standards for material posted on the internet. Please email me at},

@article{Roland2001,
abstract = {The adiabatic theorem has been recently used to design quantum algorithms of a new kind, where the quantum computer evolves slowly enough so that it remains near its instantaneous ground state which tends to the solution [1]. We apply this time-dependent Hamiltonian approach to the Grover's problem, i. e., searching a marked item in an unstructured database. We find that, by adjusting the evolution rate of the Hamiltonian so as to keep the evolution adiabatic on each infinitesimal time interval, the total running time is of order √ N , where N is the number of items in the database. We thus recover the advantage of Grover's standard algorithm as compared to a classical search, scaling as N . This is in contrast with the constant-rate adiabatic approach developed in [1], where the requirement of adiabaticity is expressed only globally, resulting in a time of order N .},

@article{Jarret2017,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce and formalize Substochastic Monte Carlo (SSMC) algorithms. These algorithms, originally intended to be a better classical foil to quantum annealing than simulated annealing, prove to be worthy optimization algorithms in their own right. In SSMC, a population of walkers is initialized according to a known distribution on an arbitrary search space and varied into the solution of some optimization problem of interest. The first argument of this paper shows how an existing classical algorithm, " Go-With-The-Winners " (GWW), is a limiting case of SSMC when restricted to binary search and particular driving dynamics. Although limiting to GWW, SSMC is more general. We show that (1) GWW can be ef-ficiently simulated within the SSMC framework, (2) SSMC can be exponentially faster than GWW, (3) by naturally incorporating structural information, SSMC can exponentially out-perform the quantum algorithm that first inspired it, and (4) SSMC exhibits desirable search features in general spaces. Our approach combines ideas from genetic algorithms (GWW), theoretical probability (Fleming-Viot processes), and quantum computing. Not only do we demonstrate that SSMC is often more efficient than competing algorithms, but we also hope that our results connecting these disciplines will impact each independently. An implemented version of SSMC has previously enjoyed some success as a competitive optimization algorithm for Max-k-SAT [1, 2].},

@article{Aharonov2005,
abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computation has recently attracted attention in the physics and com-puter science communities, but its computational power was unknown. We describe an effi-cient adiabatic simulation of any given quantum algorithm, which implies that the adiabatic computation model and the conventional quantum computation model are polynomially equiv-alent. Our result can be extended to the physically realistic setting of particles arranged on a two-dimensional grid with nearest neighbor interactions. The equivalence between the models provides a new vantage point from which to tackle the central issues in quantum computation, namely designing new quantum algorithms and constructing fault tolerant quantum computers. In particular, by translating the main open questions in the area of quantum algorithms to the language of spectral gaps of sparse matrices, the result makes these questions accessible to a wider scientific audience, acquainted with mathematical physics, expander theory and rapidly mixing Markov chains.},

@article{Farhi2000,
abstract = {We give a quantum algorithm for solving instances of the satisfiability problem, based on adiabatic evolution. The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},
